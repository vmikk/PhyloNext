# PD (Phylogenetic Diversity) in the cloud
Scripts for Biodiverse pipeline
## Introduction

Current pipeline brings together two critical research data infrastructures, the Global
Biodiversity Information Facility [(GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/) and Open Tree of Life [(OToL)](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org), to make them more accessible to non-experts.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies.
