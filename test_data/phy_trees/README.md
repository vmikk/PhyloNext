## Open Tree of Life

The phylogenetic trees below were obtained from the Open Tree of Life on February 26, 2022. 
Use these trees with caution, as they represent the synthetic approximately dated trees. 
These trees use OTT IDs for their tip labels, so if you wish to use them in PhyloNext, 
you should specify the parameter `--phylabels OTT`.

Included in this set are trees for the following groups: 
Amphibians, Birds, Australian Fabaceae, Gymnosperms, and Mammals:  

- `Amphibians_OpenTree_OTT-labels.nwk`  
- `Birds_OpenTree_OTT-labels.nwk`  
- `Fabaceae_Australia_OpenTree_OTT-labels.nwk`  
- `Gymnosperms_OpenTree_OTT-labels.nwk`  
- `Mammals_OpenTree_OTT-labels.nwk`  
- `Reptiles_OpenTree_OTT-labels.nwk`
